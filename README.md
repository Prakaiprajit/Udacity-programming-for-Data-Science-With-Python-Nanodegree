This repository contains 2 of my projects including SQL and python for Udacity Programming For Data Science Course.
### Project 1: SQL  to explore a database related to movie rentals
________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### Overview
In this project, I write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database related to movie rentals. 

For the presentation component, I had to create four slides, and each slide need to **Meet Expectations** including (a) a good question of interest, (b) a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question, (c) a supporting visualization created using the final data of your SQL query that answers your question of interest, (d) small summary on each slide.

#### Question Sets
A set of questions have also been provided by Udacity so that we were free to consider and include them in our Project Submission. [Check this out](https://github.com/Prakaiprajit/Udacity-programming-for-Data-Science-With-Python-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project-1-SQL/Project%20Question)

### Project 2: Python to explore US bikeshare data
______
#### Overview
In this project, I had to use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

#### Software requirements
- Python 3, Numpy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
- A text editor,like Sublime or Atom
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows)
-

#### The interactive Experience
This is a example that I wrote a script in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, you can see in the picture below that show the results of the information in New york city for all months on Friday.
